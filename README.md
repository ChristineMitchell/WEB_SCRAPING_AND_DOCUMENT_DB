# WEB_SCRAPING_AND_DOCUMENT_DB
Mission to Mars App. Scrape different sites and store data in a NoSQL database called, MongoDB. A NoSQL database is a less structured database referred to as a document database so that we can store things like Headliners, Tables, and Images. Also, use Splinter to automate a website, Web-Driver Manager to scrape, then Beautiful Soup to parse and extract the data.
